# DraftBot
DraftBot is a simple bot for playing a game of Draft over Discord. DraftBot also has a bit of extra functionality built in for looking up different cards and/or some stats about them. 

## Commands
### Draft
This command starts a new draft with the players who are mentioned in the command. The individual who runs the command will _always_ be included in the draft as the 1st player.

`/draft <player-2> <player-3>`

For example, if player @Justin wanted to start a match against players @Nate and @Andrew, they would type the following command:

`/draft @Nate @Andrew`
